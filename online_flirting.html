        <h2>Here are some tips</h2>
        <div class="pselfC">
           <ul class="List">
               <ol> 1. Focus on unique, specific compliments
               <br>
               <br>
                Try not to make the conversation so obviously wrapped around the “dating”, have a normal friendly conversation. Pick one thing on their profile and make fun of him/her, (in a light-hearted way). It creates instant intimacy and can reveal your charm. Apologies immediately if he/she is offended! A sincere apology can also tell that you are sentimental and care about others emotions.</ol>
                <br>
               <br>
               <br>
                <ol>
                    2. Focus on unique, specific compliments
                <br>
               <br> 
                Don’t hesitate to flatter your online crush. Talk about what he/                she has on their profile. Talk about their hair, eyes, tattoo?              -anything that makes them feel you’ve had a pit stop at their               profile before approaching. Knowing someone admires your traits             is making him/her smile in a real and that means, you’ve opened a       door, to friendship maybe, but that’s the first step.
                </ol>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    3. Avoid Yes/No questions
                    <br>
                <br>
                Don’t be a conversation killer! Generic questions get bland                 answers and online flirting is not meant to be bland. Keep the              conversation exciting, reveal yourself and try to know about the                person by asking specific questions, like- How do you like EDM?             Following text could be- I’m going to this concert and my friend            just chickened out, would you like to join?
                </ol>
<br>
<br>
<br>
                    <ol>
                        4. Don’t over do texting, Meet!
                        <br>
                        <br>
Texting for too long can put out the interest in meeting the person in actual. Online Dating apps like Sclubber, also provide Video Chat to bring you closer, make use of technology to take your online date to reality sooner. You already start getting bored of the conversations and honestly know a little too much to kill the excitement.
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        5. Talk about personality
                        <br>
                        <br>
As much as you talk about their physical features, nothing works like compliments about their happening personality. Repeat your compliment, to make an echo.
                    </ol>
<br>
<br>
<br>

                    <ol>
                        6. Exchange photos!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    
Nope, not giving you “Ideas” but yeah, showing him/her what you and your life looks like in real, makes them feel a part of your life. A simple picture of your dog or your messy study room will be fine too.
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        7. Use Interesting words
                        <br>
                        <br>
Data says, Messages that use the word adorable get 64% more responses. Amuse them with words to make them feel special about the conversations.
                    </ol>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        8. Be upfront and clear
                        <br>
